Apache Woden 1.0M10 release note
--------------------------------

This Woden release contains the following changes with respect to 1.0M9:

*   Support for the Axiom API has been removed. Starting with the 1.0M10
    release, Woden only provides an implementation that uses the DOM API
    (Note that Axiom itself has optional [support for the DOM API][1]).
    As a consequence, the `woden-api`, `woden-common` and `woden-dom`
    modules have been replaced by a single module called `woden-core`.

*   Woden now requires Java 5.

*   Woden has been upgraded to use [XmlSchema 2][2].

Woden 1.0M10 passes the same 81 test cases from the W3C test suite as previous
releases.

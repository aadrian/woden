    <section name="Introduction">
      <p>
      	The development pages of the Website are meant for those people developing or interested in the
      	development of Woden itself. These pages contain milestone plans, non-release builds, and 
      	other information specifically related to the development of Woden.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Contributing to Woden">
      <p>
      	There are many ways to contribute to Woden such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
      		<li>
      			Contribute new functionality
      		</li>
      		<li>
      			Fix open bugs
      		</li>
      		<li>
      			File new bugs
      		</li>
      		<li>
      			Contribute updates to the documentation
      		</li>
      	</ul>
      	<p>
      		Some work items for which we currently need help can be found on the
      		<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/ws/FrontPage/Woden/TaskList">Woden Task List</a>.

    </section>
	<section name="Contributing WSDL Test Cases">
      <p>
      	Like many Java based projects, Woden contains a JUnit automated test suite. This test suite is
      	used for testing the Woden implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Woden is an implementation of the W3C WSDL 2.0 specification. The WSDL 2.0 working group has
      	set up their own test suite that contains valid and invalid WSDL documents. Woden is tested
      	with the W3C WSDL test suite and recommends that sample WSDL documents be contributed to the
      	W3C WSDL test suite as opposed to the Woden test suite. For information on contributing to
      	the W3C WSDL test suite see <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/test-suite/faq.html">W3C WSDL 2.0 Test Suite FAQ</a>.

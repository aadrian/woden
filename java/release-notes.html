<h1>Woden Incubating 1.0M7 Release Notes</h1>

February 2007. This is the Milestone 7 (M7) release of <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/woden">Apache Woden</a>.<br />
The Milestone plan is at <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/woden/dev/1.0/milestoneplan.html">http://incubator.apache.org/woden/dev/1.0/milestoneplan.html</a>.

<h2>Incubation Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
  	The Woden project is an effort undergoing <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">incubation at the Apache 
  	Software Foundation (ASF)</a>, sponsored by the Apache Web Services PMC. Incubation is 
  	required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates 
  	that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have 
  	stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While 
  	incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
  	stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully 
  	endorsed by the ASF.
</p>

<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>
    <b>Milestone releases </b>
    will deliver Woden functionality gradually, leading up to a 1.0 release.
    The objective of a 1.0 release will be to deliver a WSDL processor that fully implements the
	W3C WSDL 2.0 specification, with functionality to parse WSDL 2.0 documents into the WSDL 2.0 
	component model and validate their syntax and semantics.
</p>
<p>
    <b>The W3C WSDL 2.0 specification </b>
    is still at W3C Candidate Recommendation (CR) but is close to being ready to move to 
    Proposed Recommendation (PR). There are a few CR issues to be resolved and some outstanding editorial
    actions for the spec authors, but these should be completed during February 2007. The move from PR to 
    a full W3C Recommendation (equivalent to a formal spec) is now likely around mid 2007.
</p>
<p>
	<b>The M7 release</b> fully supports the parsing of valid WSDL 2.0 documents 
    into the WSDL 2.0 Component model, as defined by the WSDL 2.0 spec and embodied in its
    Test Suite as at the <b>10th February 2007</b>. Within the WSDL 2.0 Test Suite at that date,
    there were 80 testcases in the Component Model Tests (the 'good' document testcases)
    whose WSDL documents collectively covered all of the WSDL 2.0 elements and attributes 
    defined by the spec and those defined for the SOAP and HTTP binding extensions. 
    Woden passed all of these 80 testcases. This 100% compliance level has been the main 
    development objective for the M7 release. 
    Any further change to the WSDL 2.0 spec and test suite will be implemented in Woden
    after the M7 release to maintain this level of compliance.
    The latest 'Component Model Tests Results' can be seen on the 
	<a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/test-suite/Dashboard.html">
	WSDL 2.0 Interop Dashboard</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>A second Interop event</b> was held by the WSDL 2.0 Working Group in November 2006. This 
    event consolidated the 'good' WSDL testcases, improved the Dashboard reporting mechanism and 
    helped define Woden's release criteria for M7 (i.e. passing all 'good' testcases).
    It also initiated a period of more substantial message exchange testing between the Axis2/Woden 
    implementation and the Canon implementation, using both SOAP and HTTP bindings. As at the release 
    of M7, this message exchange testing is progressing well with more varied and complex scenarios 
    being successfully tested. See the 'Message Exchange Test Results' on the Dashboard for the
    latest progress.
</p>
<p>
    The main focus of the next release will be to complete Woden's WSDL 2.0 compliance by fully supporting
    the assertions defined in the WSDL 2.0 spec. That is, completing Woden's validation logic to capture 
    violations of these assertions in the 'bad' WSDL documents in the W3C WSDL 2.0 test suite.
</p>
	Other significant functionality that remains to be delivered is:
	<ul>
	<li>Completing the API to fully support the programmatic creation and editing of WSDL 2.0 documents.</li>
	<li>Modifying the extensions API to improve its usability</li>
	<li>Serializing Woden's WSDL object model to WSDL 2.0 XML documents (i.e. a WSDLWriter).</li>
	<li>Parsing WSDL 1.1 documents into Woden's WSDL 2.0 object model.</li>
	</ul>
<p>
	The Woden parser framework and its programming model originated from WSDL4J, a WSDL 1.1 processor.
	Differences in WSDL 2.0 mean that the Woden WSDL object model is quite different to WSDL4J's,
	however other WSDL4J features have been reused or adapted, such as its extension architecture.
</p>

<h2>What's new in this release?</h2>

<p>This release includes the following new features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Many JIRAs have been resolved during M7 development that dealt with failures against the W3C WSDL 2.0 test suite.
    </li>
    <li>
        The readWSDL methods on WSDLReader now return a Description component instead of DescriptionElement.
        This is because the WSDL information in the WSDL 2.0 Component model is more useful and easier to 
        consume than in the WSDL 2.0 infoset (e.g. flattening document composition, default values). 
        Note that Description.toElement() can still be used if a DescriptionElement is required.
    </li>
    <li>
        XMLElement has been introduced to the Woden API to provide a common representation for 'element' objects 
        such as DOM Element and AXIOM OMElement. This eliminates Woden API dependencies on particular XML parsers 
        or object models. As XMLElement wraps most of the behaviour in the underlying DOM Element or OMElement, 
        it has also allowed us to refactor much of the DOMWSDLReader and OMWSDLReader implementations into a common 
        code base.
    </li>  
    <li>
        The underlying &lt;xs:schema&gt; and &lt;xs:import&gt; elements defined directly within &lt;wsdl:types&gt;
        are now accessible via the Woden Schema API as XMLElements. This allows applications to use additional schema 
        processing techniques other than WS-Commons XmlSchema if they so choose (note, XmlSchema is still used in 
        the Woden API to represent schemas).
    </li>
    <li>
        Convenience methods getAllInterfaceFaults and getAllInterfaceOperations have been added to the Interface
        component API to provide access to faults and operations derived via interface inheritance.
    </li>
    <li>
        A URL Resolver mechanism has been introduced to resolve URLs via an optional user-defined catalog. 
        This mechanism can greatly improve performance by redirecting remote requests to locally stored
        documents. It is used internally by Woden for common XML schemas and DTDs and a default user catalog
        is provided with entries for the W3C WSDL 2.0 testcases, which can be downloaded and stored locally
        by an ANT script. This mechanism resolves URLs to URLs. Further development is underway to introduce
        an 'Entity Resolver', which will resolve a URL to the actual XML content (i.e. an XML catalog). 
    </li>
    <li>
        The Feature and Property components have been removed from the WSDL 2.0 spec and so from Woden. 
    </li> 
    <li>
        The outstanding unit tests for the Element and Component APIs have been completed.
    </li>
    <li>
        The API Javadoc is more complete.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Release Structure</h2>

<p>
    The M7 release is available in 3 types of archives; zip, tar.gz and tar.bz2.
    For each archive type there is a binary and a source distribution archive, each with 
    its own MD5 and sha1 checksums.
    The source distribution contains the entire Woden Subversion source code tree.
</p>
	The binary distribution contains the Woden API Javadoc and the three Woden jar files described below:<br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			woden-api-1.0-incubating-M7.jar - Contains only the public Woden API (not yet final). 
			This jar is suitable for those that wish to create their own implementation of 
			the API.
		</li>
		<li>
			woden-1.0-incubating-M7.jar - Contains the public Woden API (not yet final) and current DOM 
			and AXIOM implementations.
		</li>
		<li>
			woden-ant-1.0-incubating-M7.jar - Contains the Ant task ValidateWSDL20 used to produce
			Woden results for the W3C WSDL 2.0 test suite.
		</li>
	</ul>
	Woden depends on the following libraries and these are also included in the binary distribution:
	<ul>
	    <li>
            Apache WS Commons XmlSchema 1.3.1 (for representing schemas in the Woden API)
	    </li>
	    <li>
            Apache Xerces 2.8.1 (used by XmlSchema and by the DOM implementation of Woden)
	    </li>
	    <li>
            Apache WS Commons AXIOM 1.2.3
	    </li>
	    <li>
            Apache Commons Logging API 1.1 (used by the AXIOM implementation of Woden)
	    </li>
	    <li>
	        StAX 1.0.1 API and the Woodstox 3.2.0 implementation  (used by the AXIOM implementation of Woden)
	    </li>
	    <li>
	        WSDL4J 1.6.2 (used by the standalone WSDL 1.1 conversion program)
	    </li>
	</ul>
<p>
The next release of Woden will produce separate distributions for the DOM and AXIOM
implementations, each with only their own dependent libraries.
</p>

<h2>What's still to do?</h2>

<p>Please see this list of what we think needs doing - and please consider helping out if 
you're interested & able! A more complete and up-to-date list of ToDos is the Woden JIRA issues at
<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/Woden">http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/Woden</a>.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	    Various API changes (see JIRA)
	</li>
	<li>
	    Modularizing the build to separate the DOM and AXIOM distributions
	</li>
	<li>
	    The User Guide on the Woden website requires ongoing improvement.
	</li>
	<li>
		Technical design documentation for developers needs to be created. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Integrating the stand-alone WSDL 1.1 to 2.0 converter tool into Woden to produce
		a Woden WSDL 2.0 object model from a parsed WSDL 1.1. document. 
	</li>
  	<li>
  		Validation of MEPs and extension elements (such as those for SOAP and HTTP bindings) 
  		has not yet been implemented.
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		Serialization (e.g. WSDLWriter) has not been implemented.
  	</li>
  	<li>
		Support for non-XML Schema type systems has not yet been implemented (e.g. RelaxNG, DTDs).
	</li>
	<li>
	    Entity resolver and an XML catalog mechanism
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
   WSDLFactory factory = WSDLFactory.newInstance();
   WSDLReader reader = factory.newWSDLReader();
   reader.setFeature(ReaderFeatures.VALIDATION_FEATURE_ID, true); &lt;-- enable WSDL 2.0 validation (optional) 
   Description descComp = reader.readWSDL(wsdlLoc);               &lt;-- the Description component, always returned
   DescriptionElement descElem = descComp.toElement();            &lt;-- the &lt;description&gt; element, if required
</pre>
   A custom error handler can also be specified as follows:<br />
<pre>
   Description descComp = reader.readWSDL(wsdlLoc, myErrorHandler);
</pre>
   WSDL can be parsed from some underlying object or byte stream content (rather than a URL) using a WSDLSource object:<br />
<pre>
   WSDLFactory factory = WSDLFactory.newInstance();
   WSDLReader reader = factory.newWSDLReader();
   reader.setFeature(WSDLReader.FEATURE_VALIDATION, true);
   WSDLSource wsdlSource = reader.createWSDLSource();  //the WSDLSource impl is specific to the WSDLReader impl
   wsdlSource.setBaseURI(wsdlURI);
   wsdlSource.setSource(wsdlSrc);                      //where wsdlSrc might be a DOM Document or Element object
   Description descComp = reader.readWSDL(wsdlSource);
</pre>

<h2>Known Problems/Issues</h2>

<ol>
   	<li>
   	    The StAX/AXIOM implementation is less complete than the Xerces/DOM implementation and
   	    some functionality is not yet implemented (e.g. parsing of extenions).
   	</li>
	<li>
		Currently, the only type system supported is W3C XML Schema and this is exposed at 
   		certain points of the API (through the use of the XmlSchema interface). Later on we
   		will consider more general, extendable support for other type systems.
   	</li>
	<li>
	    Validation does not yet cover all WSDL 2.0 assertions and in fact, the W3C WSDL 2.0 
	    Assertion Test Suite Coverage report shows that 'bad' WSDL testcases for some of these 
	    assertions do not not yet exist (i.e. this test suite is incomplete).
	    So, there will currently be some Woden failures on the WSDL 2.0 Validation Tests 
	    report on the Dashboard.
	</li>
	<li>
	    The current extension mechanism mandates statically typed interfaces for each type of
	    extension. This requires the client application to know each required extension and
	    its API. Some investigation has been done on a more flexible, dynamic extension 
	    mechanism and any changes that arise from this will be delivered in M8 (this was deferred
	    on the M7 plan due to lack of time and resources).
	</li>
	<li>
	    To improve performance, a better mechanism is required for caching retrieved documents to
	    reduce network requests. This will be addressed along side work on the XML Entity Resolver
	    described above.  
	</li>
</ol>
